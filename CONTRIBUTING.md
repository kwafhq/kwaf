- `make test-coverage` - Generate HTML coverage report

#### Code Quality
- `make lint` - Run golangci-lint with project configuration
- `make format` - Format code with gofmt and goimports

#### Run Commands
- `make run-cp` - Build and run control plane
- `make run-dp` - Build and run data plane

#### Docker Commands
- `make docker-build` - Build all Docker images
- `make docker-build-cp` - Build control plane image
- `make docker-build-dp` - Build data plane image
- `make docker-build-ctl` - Build CLI image

#### Development Helpers
- `make dev` - Setup development environment
